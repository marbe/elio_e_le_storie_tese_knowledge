  - context: |
      The origins of "Elio e le Storie Tese" go back to the 1970s, when Stefano
      Belisari (Elio), Luca Mangoni and Marco Conforti (Sergio's brother and future
      manager of the group) were classmates in a high school in Milan. The first line-
      up debuted in Milan in 1980. It consisted of Elio on guitar, Paolo Cortellino
      on bass and Pier Luigi Zuffellato on drums. Cortellino was then replaced
      firstly by Fabio Gianvecchio (Chiosco), later by Dario Mazzoli (Scaffale), and
      finally, in 1986, by Nicola Fasani (Faso). In the meantime, Zuffellato had left
      the group, and was replaced by Vittorio Cosma until 1982, when, after EelST
      were joined by the pianist Sergio Conforti (Rocco Tanica), the role of drummer
      was filled by a Drumulator operated by Rocco Tanica himself until 1988, when
      Swiss drummer Christian Meyer joined the group.At the beginning, Elio was the
      singer and guitarist, but in 1983 the group hired rock guitarist Davide
      Civaschi (Cesareo). From that moment on, Elio could focus on being the front-
      man, and, sparingly, play the Western concert flute, for which he had passed
      the music academy's examination. In 1988, the group was also joined by the
      multi-instrumentalist Paolo Panigada (Feiez), who died ten years later of a
      brain hemorrhage during a concert.In 1992, Elio decided to include architect
      and former classmate Mangoni in the band. Mangoni, described in the official
      website as "artist and architect", would have various roles, such as dancing
      and singing during live performances.The first studio album, Elio samaga
      hukapan kariyana turu was published in 1989, and it was followed by The Los Sri
      Lanka Parakramabahu Brothers Featuring Elio e le Storie Tese (1990), İtalyan,
      rum casusu çikti (1992), Esco dal mio corpo e ho molta paura: Gli inediti 1979–
      1986 (1993), Eat the Phikis (1996), Peerla (1998), Craccracriccrecr (1999),
      Cicciput (2003), Studentessi (2008) and L'album biango (2013). During their 35-
      year career, EelST have been awarded several prizes; they came second twice in
      the Sanremo Music Festival (in (1996 and 2013); they also won two "Mia Martini"
      Critics' Awards.In March 2014, "Elio e le Storie Tese" presented six episodes
      of Il Musichione, a comedy musical show on Rai 2. On 17 October 2017, the band
      announced that they would disband at the end of the year, after their last
      concert in Milan on 19 December. On 16 December 2017, it was announced that the
      band would take part in the Sanremo Music Festival 2018 with the song
      Arrivedorci, i.e. "Arrivederci", meaning "See you later" in Italian; the song
      title is misspelled in the same way in which Alberto Sordi intentionally
      mispronounced the word, with a fake and exaggerated American accent (mostly for
      comic effect), while dubbing Oliver Hardy in the Italian versions of Laurel and
      Hardy films, from 1939 to 1951). The song, a slow ballad with a lyric
      consisting in a half-comical, half-serious concise recapitulation of their
      history, came last in the final chart and it was called by journalist and music
      critic Mario Luzzatto Fegiz "the ugliest song [they] ever wrote"; Elio,
      replying to Fegiz in an ambiguous attitude, stated that the band had made a
      calculated effort to classify last. A follow-up "Tour D'Addio" ("Farewell
      Tour") was announced for the Spring of 2018 starting on April 20 and ending on
      June 29. Later on, during a June 30, 2018 meet-and-greet in Barolo, for the
      tenth edition of its Collisioni rock music festival, Elio clarified that the
      main reasons behind the band's break-up were Tanica's recurring and continued
      absence from their stage performances during the previous years, due to health
      reasons – namely depression (although the keyboardist never gave up his
      official membership in the band, by continuing to play keyboards and synths on
      their studio albums) – and a general tiredness within the band after their long
      career.On 5 April 2022, "Elio e le Storie Tese" announced a reunion concert to
      be held in July of the same year. The purpose of the event is to raise funds to
      help Ukrainian refugees fleeing their country after the Russian invasion of
      Ukraine.On 5 June 2023, the band announces, on Radio Deejay and on their own
      website, the resumption of live activities and an autumn tour in theaters with
      the show "Mi resta un solo dente e cerco di riavvitarlo" ("I have only one
      tooth left, and I'm trying to screw it back in") directed by Giorgio Gallione.

  - context: |
      The music of the group is openly inspired, among other sources, by the style of
      Frank Zappa, both in music and lyrics. Elio e le Storie Tese's musical work is
      characterized by eclecticism and competence, in the melodic, harmonic and
      orchestration (arrangement) aspects, augmented by the members' technical
      proficiency. They are widely considered as some of the best musicians in Italy.
      They are usually joined by an "unofficial" member, Mangoni (a former schoolmate
      of Elio and actually an architect), whose role is to dance, make choreographies
      or even sing during live shows on stage. In their official discography, and in
      their gigs, EelST have covered many of the genres typified in popular music:
      rock, Latin, progressive rock, disco and soul, to name a few. A very strong
      attitude to affectionately mock and modify to their needs the clichès of
      Italian pop music has always been part of their musical career, and nonetheless
      many Italian pop artists have been proud guests in their recordings,
      acknowledging their value. Their songs are typically interspersed by a rude,
      coarse humour which lies in stark contrast to their extreme varied and
      competent musical talent; once the band was considered part of the 'demential'
      rock underground spawned after the demise of punk and cross-fertilized by
      situationist dadaism, but they have soared well past above that scene. One of
      their favourite themes is adolescent life, seen as a golden period of fun,
      friendship, music and sexual discoveries. The band has also been the first one,
      in 2004, to sell instant CDs of their live performances immediately after their
      end (which they dubbed CD brulé, as they were 'burned' on the spot, like mulled
      wine, in Italian "vin brulé").
